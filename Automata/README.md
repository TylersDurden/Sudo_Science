# *CELLULAR_AUTOMATA* 
The definition of an Automata is something **self-operating**. 
In the case of Cellular Automata, the self operation is one on
a flat space of numbers (bit plane). 

By defining a 'neighborhood' around each pixel (of various sizes! 
and configurations), and specifying rules about the results of 
doing some matrix multiplication of the 'neighborhood' rules on 
the original bit-plane space, ***an unlimited variety of possible 
behavior can be engineered.*** 

## Conway's Game of Life 
Probably the most popular incarnation of a cellular automata, the
Conway Game of Life simulation is a great example to start with to
understand the fundamentals of the cellular automata.
