Some fun coding Projects. 

## Automata 
If you don't know about Automata, [check it out](https://tylersdurden.github.io/Sudo_Science/Automata/).
You can do all kinds of neat things, with pretty simple code:

## Random Walks 
![Here](https://github.com/TylersDurden/Robots) You will find many Random Walk experiments. 
A random walk is when a particle moves about a space with a set of steps which are ideally
entirely random. 

I also look at Diffusion-Limited Aggregation, which uses many random walkers who basically 
"die in place" if they run out of steps or collide with another particle. This produces 
interesting systems that seem to grow external structures off of them.

Lastly, I look at creating a random walk agent armed with some automata-like rules to try 
and make some basic decisions about the next step against the random decisions it's been
generating. 

As previously states, these projects can be found in the ![Robots](https://tylersdurden.github.io/Robots/)
repo.

## Text/Image Processing 
I want to experiment with how fonts are rendered various related aspects of image processing
like dithering and filterting. These projects can be found in the ![insight](https://github.com/TylersDurden/insight) 
repository.
